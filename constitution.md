If the Association wants to alter or rescind any of these rules, or to make additional rules, the Association may do so only by special resolution and by otherwise complying with Part 3 Division 2 of the Act.

Note for this rule:

Section 31 of the Act requires an incorporated association to obtain the Commissioner’s approval if the alteration of its rules has effect to change the name of the association. 
Section 33 of the Act requires an incorporated association to obtain the Commissioner’s approval if the alteration of its rules has effect to alter the objects or purposes of the association or the manner in which surplus property of the association must be distributed or dealt with if the association is wound up or its incorporation is cancelled. 

Guidance Note – Alteration of Rules. Amendments to the rules do not take effect until required documents are lodged with the Commissioner, even if the amendments do not require the approval of the Commissioner under section 31 or section 33.  The required documents must be lodged within one month after the special resolution is passed.
